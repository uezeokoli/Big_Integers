Files:

1. Arithmetic.cpp:
    C++ source file which takes two command line arguments (name of file to read and name of output file). The file contains two strings of integers that determines the value of BigInteger A and B. Output file contains operations of A and B.
2. BigInteger.cpp: 
    C++ source file which is used to define the declared functions and incoporates the BigInteger.
3. BigInteger.h: 
    header file which is used to declare functions and construct the ADT BigInteger.
4. BigIntegerTest.cpp:
    C++ source file which is used to determine if defined functions in BigIntegerTest.cpp are working as expected 
5. List.h:
    header file which is used to declare functions and construct the ADTs Node and List
6. List.cpp:
    C++ source file which is used to define the declared functions and incoporates the List and Node ADT
7. ListTest.cpp: 
    C++ source file which is used to determine if defined functions in List.cpp are working as expected 
8. Makefile:
    makefile which compiles code and creates executables ListTest, BigIntegerTest, and Arithmetic. Can also check for memory errors in Arithmetic, BigIntegerTest, and ListTest with command make ArithmeticCheck, make BigIntegerCheck, and make ListCheck.
